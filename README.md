# Movie list

[_app still on WIP_]

Web application that allows users to keep a list of pending movies in a WatchLater-like list.

## Features

* [_Work in progress_] **Keep track of those movies that you would like to watch later**. Search for movies in our catalog and add it to your pending list, or add one yourself if that movie is not on our Available Movies list.

* [_Work in progress_] **Cross movies as you watch them**. Instead of deleting movies from your list, you can mark them as watched so they don't appear on your main page, but still keep them on your list.

* [_Work in progress_] **Know where you can watch a movie right within the app**. For those movies on our Available Movies list there will be information like a description of the movie, genre, images, and most importantly, a list of those streaming services where you can watch them in your region.

* [_Work in progress_] **Tag movies with your own categories**. Organize your pending list using tags to create different mini-lists of movies. For when you have a set of movies that you want to see with your family/friends, or maybe when there's a specific director who you want to see more movies from. 

* [_Work in progress_] **Share your pending movies and colaborate with other users**. Enable other users to see those movies that tagged with a category. You can even allow specific users to be able to colaborate on your pending movies list with public tags.
